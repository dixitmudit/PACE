The workbook contains the code and notebook to run PACE (Precise and Accurate Configuration Evaluation).


## üöÄ Environment Setup
- System requirements: This package requires a standard Linux computer with GPU (supports CUDA >= 10) and enough RAM (> 2 GB). The code has been tested on NVIDIA V100 SXM2. If you want to run the code on a GPU that does not support CUDA>=10, you need to modify the versions of PyTorch and CUDA in the [env.yml](env.yml) file.
- We'll use `conda` to install dependencies and set up the environment for a Nvidia GPU machine.
We recommend using the [Miniconda installer](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-other-installer-links.html).
- After installing `conda`, install [`mamba`](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to the base environment. `mamba` is a faster, drop-in replacement for `conda`:
    ```bash
    conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
    ```
- Then create a conda environment and install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    mamba env create -f env.yml
    ```
    Activate the conda environment with `conda activate pace-env`.



## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```sh
pip install pace
```

if PyPI installation fails or you need the latest `main` branch commits, you can install from source:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/dixitmudit/PACE.git
```
    
## üß™ Getting Started

### 1. Direct Usage

```bash
  python main.py --model /path/to/your/mace/model.model --metals Fe-Ru Fe-Mo --adsorbates Li2S Li2S2 --device cuda
```

### 2. Example notebook
[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/google_colab-open_in_colab?style=flat-square&logo=googlecolab)](https://github.com/dixitmudit/PACE/blob/main/examples/pace-results.ipynb)

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://github.com/dixitmudit/PACE/blob/main/examples/pace-results.ipynb)

### 3. PACE class to screen
```bash
from pace import PACE
from 

# Setup PACE:
pace = PACE(base=base, adsorbate=adsorbate, division=5, z_levels=[1.35, 1.75])
# Handy VS Code feature: Hover over PAACE or any method/function to obtain info about arguments

# Screen conformations
results = pace.screen(calculator=mace_calc, fig_save_at='/your/path/here', mlip_optimization=3)
# if mlip_optimization > 0, it will initate mlip optimization of top `input: integer` (by_default: 20) structures.


```
